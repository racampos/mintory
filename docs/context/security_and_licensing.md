# Security & Licensing Constraints

- No private keys server-side; signing only via wallet.
- Positive portrayals only for named figures.
- Document model and license in README.
- Store prompts, seeds, and sources in metadata for transparency.
- Do not fetch or scrape live sources in backend during demo; treat sources as citations only.
