# Env & Addresses Rule

**Consult first:** `docs/context/env_and_configs.md`, `docs/context/contracts_and_addresses.md`.

- Load `RPC_URL`, `CHAIN_ID`, and contract addresses from `.env` + `infra/deploy/addresses.json`.
- Provide `.env.example` with all required keys.
- Do not hardcode private keys or secrets. Never commit real `.env`.
- Frontend must read `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` vars only.
