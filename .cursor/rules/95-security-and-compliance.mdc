# Security & Licensing Rule

**Consult first:** `docs/context/security_and_licensing.md`, `PROJECT+BACKGROUND.md`.

- Signing only in the browser wallet; servers never hold keys or mnemonics.
- Positive depictions for named figures; avoid sensitive/negative portrayals.
- Document the image model and license in README; store prompts/seeds/sources in metadata for transparency.
- No scraping live sources in backend during demo; treat sources as citations only.
