# Testing & Demo Rule

**Consult first:** `docs/context/testing_plan.md`, `docs/context/demo_script.md`.

- Unit (contracts): open/close vote, finalizeMint, medal mint.
- Integration: MCP `start_vote` returns executable **PreparedTx**; `pin_metadata` CID resolves.
- E2E: Start run → `lore_approval` → art → vote → finalize → tokenURI resolves → medal minted.
- Implement a demo script runner or README steps that mirror `demo_script.md`.
