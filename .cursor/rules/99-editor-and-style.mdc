# Editor & Style Rule

- Keep PRs small and map them to specific sections of:
  - `PROJECT+BACKGROUND.md`
  - `docs/context/*`
- Add header comments in new files referencing the spec sections used (paths).
- Prefer explicit types and narrow interfaces; avoid `any`.
- Include TODOs only with file+line references to the spec that must be resolved later.
